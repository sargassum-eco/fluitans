# Fluitans

Server application for provisioning and managing ZeroTier networks, domain names, organizations, and registries

Named after [_Sargassum fluitans_](https://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?tc=accept&species_id=825) (the broadleaf gulfweed), one of the dominant sargassum species found in the Sargasso Sea, this server application is a prototype for a user-friendly way of managing ZeroTier networks.

## Usage

The binaries generated by this project should be entirely self-contained, except for the other services which Fluitans needs to talk to. You can simply run the Fluitans binary from anywhere, though you'll need to set some environment variables to specify how Fluitans should talk to the services it depends on.

### Development

Before you start the server for the first time, you'll need to generate the webapp build artifacts by running `make buildweb`. Then you can start the server using golang's `go run` by running `make run`. You will need to have installed golang first. Any time you modify the webapp files (in the web/app directory), you'll need to run `make buildweb` again.

### Building

To execute the full build pipeline, run `make`; to build the docker images, run `make build`. You will need to have installed golang and golangci-lint first; `make build` *should* automatically install golangci-lint, but this might not work; if not, you'll need to install it manually. Note that `make build` will also automatically regenerate the webapp build artifacts.
